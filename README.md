## Project overview

The aim of this project is to provide a thorough analysis and eventually
build model using machine learning algorithms to predict the housing prices in 
the city of [Lund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund) where I am currently 
living. I hope this project could not only provide a general 
overview of the recent Lund housing market, but also answer business-like questions for the potential housing buyers/sellers like:

* When is the best time to sell/buy an apartment/house?
* If you are going to sell a property, which agency (or even more 
  progressively, whom) 
  you should call?
  
* What is the reasonable price for a given property with parameters like 
  location, living area size, number of rooms, floor number, year of build, 
  etc.?
