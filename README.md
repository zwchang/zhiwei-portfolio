# Analysis and Prediction of Apartment Sales in Lund, Sweden

The aim of this project is to provide a thorough analysis and eventually
build model using machine learning algorithms to predict the housing prices in 
the city of [Lund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund) where I am currently 
living. I hope this project could not only provide a general 
overview of the recent Lund housing market, but also answer business-like questions for the potential housing buyers/sellers like:

* When is the best time to sell/buy an apartment/house?
* If you are going to sell a property, which agency (or even more 
  progressively, whom) 
  you should call?
  
* What is the reasonable price for a given property with parameters like 
  location, living area size, number of rooms, floor number, year of build, 
  etc.?
  
  
# Assignments from Andrew Ng's machine learning online course rewritten using Python

Here I gradually upload Python solutions for the exercises of the famous online [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course from _Andrew Ng_. Like many other, this course introduced me into the ML and AI world. For the educational purpose, here I try not only rewrite all original Matlab codes in Python but also implement corresponding algorithms in Scikit-learn as a comparison. Some problems are solved using different methods.
